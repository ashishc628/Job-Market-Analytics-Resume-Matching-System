SELECT s.skill, COUNT(*) as frequency
FROM jobs j 
JOIN skills s ON j.job_id = s.job_id
WHERE j.title ILIKE '%Data Analyst%'
GROUP BY s.skill
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Cities hiring the most for AI/ML roles
SELECT j.location, COUNT(*) as job_count
FROM jobs j
WHERE j.full_description ILIKE '%machine learning%' 
   OR j.full_description ILIKE '%artificial intelligence%'
GROUP BY j.location
ORDER BY job_count DESC;
```
